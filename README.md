# BasicAnalysis

Scan_cut_original.C = Run in ROOT. Take the files in the TChain and see how many events pass the quality cut

Make_offline_plot.C = Run in ROOT. Make a NOvA style histogram. 

Create_newfilewithCUTS.C = Run in ROOT. Take an Upmu histogram and cuts on the variables to have a file with only selected events.

sorteANDcheck_mom.py = Sort and check momentum of simulated neutrino particles from log file to determine if there are duplicates


UpMuSim_plots.C and WimpSim_plot.C = makes relevant plots for the upward going muon simulation

efficiency_vs_variable.C = plot the efficiency vs a variable in TGraph
